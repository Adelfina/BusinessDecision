Project Overview
This project involves performing detailed statistical analyses on two distinct business cases: a Sales Team Competition and Breakfast Cereal Focus Groups. The objective is to provide insights and make data-driven decisions using statistical methods.

Sales Team Competition
In this analysis, we compare the performance of two sales teams based on their sales figures. The aim is to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average sales performance of the two teams.

Breakfast Cereal Focus Groups
This part of the project focuses on evaluating five new versions of a childrenâ€™s breakfast cereal. The evaluation is based on ratings given by children in focus groups. The goal is to determine if there are significant differences in the mean ratings of the five cereal versions.

ANOVA Table Construction
Data Visualization: Histograms to display the distribution of ratings and the F-distribution.

Results Interpretation
Sales Team Competition: Based on the p-value and the t-statistic, conclusions are drawn regarding the performance differences between the two sales teams.
Breakfast Cereal Focus Groups: The ANOVA test results help in understanding whether the mean ratings of the cereals are significantly different, guiding the manufacturer's decision on which cereal version to pursue.
Data
Sales figures for two sales teams and taste ratings for five cereal versions.
Data is processed and visualized to facilitate analysis.
Conclusion
This project exemplifies the application of statistical methods in real-world business scenarios. The analyses provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making processes in organizations.
